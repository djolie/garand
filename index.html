          <h1>Thoughts on ValioCon</h1>

          <p>Lets face it, we all spend a majority of our time on the web. Wether it be interacting with each other on twitter, checking out each others work on dribbble, or chatting back and forth on Skype. While that is essential to building relationships with everyone in the industry, its not enough.</p>

          <p>Last year <a href="#">Drew Wilson</a>, of Valio, announced a <strong>brand new conference</strong>, aptly named ValioCon. His aim wasn't to create a <em>big name speaker list</em> and cram a bunch of people in a small room and fill them full of information that they may or may not be interested in. Nor did he schedule multiple talks at the same time slots and force you to pick between them. Instead he selectively picked speakers from multiple aspects of the web, and scheduled things so every attendee was able to attend eavery talk.</p>

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Vivamus sagittis lacus vel augue laoreet rutrum faucibus dolor auctor.</li>
              <li>Donec ullamcorper nulla non metus auctor fringilla.</li>
              <li>Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor.</li>
              <li>Donec id elit non mi porta gravida at eget metus.</li>
              <li>Cras justo odio, dapibus ac facilisis in, egestas eget quam.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>Everything was setup beautifully and ran very smoothly. The majority of people arrived on Friday and Drew had his brother, Jesse, running a shuttle back and forth all day to pick us up and bring us to the Carlsbad Inn (awesome place by the way). Because of the small number of attendees, everyone felt comfortable and just started talking with each other and introducing themselves. I spent a few minutes trying to match faces with twitter avatars, but whats the point when you can just walk up to people and introduce yourselves.</p>

          <h2>Getting Started</h2>

          <p>Everyone was very down-to-earth and just as excited as you to meet everyone. I had to keep telling myself that we're all just people and twitter followers don't really matter. The speakers were excited to just sit and chat with people and get to know everyone. I was blessed with the chance to talk to people I admire and also given the opportunity to let them know what I can bring to the table. Who knows, maybe that will lead to something awesome (by the way, I do front-end dev).</p>

          <h3>Bonfire at the Beach</h3>

          <p>So back to the conference. Friday's bonfire didn't end up going exactly as Drew planned, our space ended up being a lot smaller. But some people said the stripper pole on the bus made up for it. It was cool to have random people walk up to you and introduce themselves and then just talk to them for a few minutes until someone else did the same thing.</p>
