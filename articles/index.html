        <h1>Graceful Improvements with CSS3</h1>
        <p>I've been using CSS3 on a number of projects recently and I'd like to share a few things I've found useful when using things such as linear-gradient, box-shadow, and rgba values in my designs, while not forgoing support for browsers that have yet to support these features.</p>

        <h1>On Productivity</h1>
        <p>What is the definition of "a good work day"? To some that may be getting into the office early, working late, killing yourself to get things done to get a promotion. To others it may be putting in the bare minimum, getting in at 9 and taking off right at 5. To me it has much less to do about the amount of time spent at work, and much more to do with the quality of the time. Jason Fried put it best in his book, Rework.</p>

        <h1>On Disconnecting</h1>
        <p>We live every day connected to the world around us, wherever we are. We spend our day working at our computers, and whenever we are away from that, we have our phones nearby. We feel this need to always be accessible. Whether that be by phone, email, instant messenger, skype, twitter, or any of the dozens of other services that alert us within seconds of when someone wants our attention. Why do we feel that need? Why do we always need to be reachable?</p>

        <h1>On ValioCon 2011</h1>
        <p>Last year Drew Wilson, of Valio, announced a brand new conference, aptly named ValioCon. His aim wasn't to create a big name speaker list and cram a bunch of people in a small room and fill them full of information that they may or may not be interested in. Nor did he schedule multiple talks at the same time slots and force you to pick between them. Instead he selectively picked speakers from multiple aspects of the web, and scheduled things so every attendee was able to attend eavery talk.</p>
