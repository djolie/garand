I was playing around with Twitter's new Follow Button and I couldn't help but notice that the embedding markup is some of the best I've ever seen.

I love the idea of using regular HTML with feature-flags in `data` attributes combined with a common script. Can't wait to play around with this style on [Gist](https://gist.github.com).
