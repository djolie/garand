title: Thoughts on ValioCon 2011
excerpt: Lets face it, we all spend a majority of our time on the web. Wether it be interacting with each other on twitter, checking out each others work on [dribbble][], or chatting back and forth on Skype. While that is essential to building relationships with everyone in the industry, its not enough.

Lets face it, we all spend a majority of our time on the web. Wether it be interacting with each other on twitter, checking out each others work on [dribbble][], or chatting back and forth on Skype. While that is essential to building relationships with everyone in the industry, its not enough.

Last year [Drew Wilson][], of [Valio][], announced a brand new conference, aptly named [ValioCon][]. His aim wasn't to create a big name speaker list and cram a bunch of people in a small room and fill them full of information that they may or may not be interested in. Nor did he schedule multiple talks at the same time slots and force you to pick between them. Instead he selectively picked speakers from multiple aspects of the web, and scheduled things so every attendee was able to attend eavery talk.

Everything was setup beautifully and ran very smoothly. The majority of people arrived on Friday and Drew had his brother, Jesse, running a shuttle back and forth all day to pick us up and bring us to the [Carlsbad Inn][] (awesome place by the way). Because of the small number of attendees, everyone felt comfortable and just started talking with each other and introducing themselves. I spent a few minutes trying to match faces with twitter avatars, but whats the point when you can just walk up to people and introduce yourselves.

Everyone was very down-to-earth and just as excited as you to meet everyone. I had to keep telling myself that we're all just people and twitter followers don't really matter. The speakers were excited to just sit and chat with people and get to know everyone. I was blessed with the chance to talk to people I admire and also given the opportunity to let them know what I can bring to the table. Who knows, maybe that will lead to something awesome (by the way, [I do front-end dev][]).

So back to the conference. Friday's bonfire didn't end up going *exactly* as Drew planned, our space ended up being a lot smaller. But some people said the stripper pole on the bus made up for it. It was cool to have random people walk up to you and introduce themselves and then just talk to them for a few minutes until someone else did the same thing.

Once getting back to the inn, we got a group together and headed down to [Pizza Port][] for more hang out time (totally not 444m away). Sitting in a circle with beer, pizza, and creative nerds was awesome. Sharing stories, talking about whatever came to mind, and convincing [Ismael Burciaga][] to spend way too much money on a plane ticket were just a few of the things that occurred that first night.

Day 2 started out with trying to find out where food was. After following our noses (read: twitter) we encountered [Kyle Steed's beautifully designed banner][] and a room with swag bags and food. More mingling between nerds, then an introduction by Drew formally started off the conference.

Drew said that the slides and videos will be online at some point, so whenever those are avaliable the links will also be here.

[Brad Smith][] knocked it out of the park with his extremely honest talk on The Business of Starting Up. He spoke very openly about what went on with [Virb][], social network turned website builder, and stressed that quitting doesn't automatically equal failure.

Next up, the incredibly talented [Anton Zynkin][] of [SoftFacade][] on The Anatomy of an Icon. Do I really need to say anything here? We all know they're absolutely amazing at what they do and we'll never come close (that means you [Jeff][]). But in all seriousness. Anton spoke greatly about their process in creating their masterpeices, different types of icons, and what elements are essential for a successful icon. Awesome job Anton, you guys are incredible.

Giveaway came, and speaker followed, the 3rd dude.

[Ethan Dunham][] of [FontSquirell][] and [FontSpring][] spoke about fonts, hinting, and ~~how to sneak Gotham on the web~~ basically a status update on what webfonts are up to on the web. He showed off some pretty fancy stuff thats possible with the CSS font stack. Check out his slides when they are avaliabl TRUNCATED! Please download pandoc if you want to convert large files.
