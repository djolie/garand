title: Standing Desk
excerpt:
  So I've had my standing desk for a week now, and albeit I haven't spent a whole lot of time at it, the time I have spent has been enjoyable. As I expected, my feet began to hurt after about an hour. I found myself leaning on the desk or standing weird then forcing myself to stand normally.

So I've had my standing desk for a week now, and albeit I haven't spent a whole lot of time at it, the time I have spent has been enjoyable. As I expected, my feet began to hurt after about an hour. I found myself leaning on the desk or standing weird then forcing myself to stand normally. 

A big thing to make sure is that the height of the desk is right for your height. Your elbows should be at about a 90 degree angle to the desk. Also make sure your monitor is at a natural height for your eyes. Get another stand for your monitor(s) if necessary. Remember you don't need to go out and buy a "standing desk". Depending on your current desk you may be able to put boxes underneath the legs to lift it up and see if you like it before investing in furniture. I, for instance, took two old, broken, subwoofers and put them under the legs, that seemed to work well for me. Check out the following links for some more insight from people who have made the switch.

To be continued next week.
