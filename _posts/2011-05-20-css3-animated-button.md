Because everybody needs an awesome CSS3 button.

Whipped this demo together in about an hour. Check out the source, it's fairly straight forward. If you guys like this I could be persuaded to make more demos and write up a tutorial on how to do it. Feel free to use this code however you wish, steal it, hack it, cut it up, whatever you desire.

Anyways, [check it out here](http://labs.anthonygarand.com/animated-circle/) and [tell me how much you like it](http://twitter.com/?status=Check%20out%20this%20slick%20animated%20CSS%20button%20by%20%40garand%20http%3A%2F%2Fgrnd.cc%2F6p28).
