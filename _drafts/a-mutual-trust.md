# An Inherit Trust

How people in our industry have mutual trust for each other and a relationship that breaks out of the old "internet friends" term. We will talk solely online, meet in person, and share a room, etc.

If you break it down for someone outside of "our world" it sounds like this:

I just spent the night alone in a room with someone that I met on the internet and trusted them with the safety of thousands of dollars of computer equipment.

Such a weird relationship, and yet, I love it.
